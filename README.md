## Prerequisites

Please contact your Integration Analyst for any questions about the below prerequisites.

* Create Express test account: http://www.elementps.com/Resources/Create-a-Test-Account
* Run a few transactions using the test account above so that there are transactions to report on

## Step 1: Create TransactionQuery XML

```
private string buildTransactionQuery(ConfigurationData configurationData, DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate)
{                           
    XNamespace express = "https://reporting.elementexpress.com";

    XDocument doc = new XDocument(new XElement(express + "TransactionQuery",
                                       new XElement(express + "Credentials",
                                           new XElement(express + "AccountID", configurationData.AccountId),
                                           new XElement(express + "AccountToken", configurationData.AccountToken),
                                           new XElement(express + "AcceptorID", configurationData.AcceptorId)
                                                    ),
                                        new XElement(express + "Application",
                                            new XElement(express + "ApplicationID", configurationData.ApplicationId),
                                            new XElement(express + "ApplicationVersion", configurationData.ApplicationVersion),
                                            new XElement(express + "ApplicationName", configurationData.ApplicationName)
                                                    ),
                                        new XElement(express + "Parameters",
                                            new XElement(express + "TransactionDateTimeBegin", startDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd")),
                                            new XElement(express + "TransactionDateTimeEnd", endDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd"))
                                                    )
                                               )
                                 );
    return doc.ToString();
}

```

## Step 2: Send a Transaction to Express

This project uses an HttpSender object which basically wraps .net's HttpWebRequest.

```
response = httpSender.Send(request, configurationData.ExpressReportingXMLEndpoint, string.Empty);

```

## Step 3: Receive response and parse

The response is returned as an XML string from Express, the code below loads the XML into an XmlDocument and then parses the XML into an object model which you can find in the Models folder.  This model object is then used to pass to the View to build the transaction table.

```
  var xmlDoc = new XmlDocument();
  xmlDoc.LoadXml(response);
  return ParseResponse(xmlDoc);

```
